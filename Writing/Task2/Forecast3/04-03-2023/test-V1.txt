Many students choose to take a gap year instead of applying to universities after graduating. Youngsters generally possess a huge desire to explore, which is one of the reasons why high school students opt to work or travel before enrolling in a new academic pursuit. This essay will examine both advantages and disadvantages of this phenomenon.

A year free from studies provides students with opportunities to travel and taking a gap year encourages students to step out of their comfort zones. Meanwhile, students are able to experience distant regions, and different cultures, which helps to broaden their knowledge about cultural diversity. Furthermore, many students have been choosing to seek a part-time job in their gap year. Working not only teaches them about the value of money but also helps them hone skills relevant to their desired profession. For example, a job selling products in a technological store could facilitate a student to study Information Technologies major in the future.

On the other hand, a gap year poses potential risks. The biggest problem every gap year taker might encounter is budget. Unless students have a good financial plan, they will suffer from a shortage of money during the gap year journey. Additionally, the students would face adaptability difficulties once the gap year ends. Having been away from studying for a significant amount of time, they might find it difficult to handle academic responsibilities.

In conclusion, besides the advantages that taking a gap year provides, it does have some detrimental impacts. Students must severely consider before taking risks.
