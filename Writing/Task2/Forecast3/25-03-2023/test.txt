Many cities have been encouraging public transportation as an alternative to private vehicles by using a regulation name 'vehicle-free days'. Though this might be a debatable topic, I advocate that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

On one hand, there are some particular drawbacks of this approach. On top of the list is the inconvenience for those who have commuting difficulties and disruption for commuters generally. For instance, delivery drivers and emergency services can not rely on public transport, so that they must obviously suffer to navigate through the city to reach the destination on time. Furthermore, businesses located in the city center which rely on the amount of daily visitor may experience a damage to not only their revenue but also their reputation. As a consequence, this phenomenon leads to the disappearance of shops and more general, the economic status of the city.

On the other hand, there are marvelous good aspects that the vehicle-free days brings. One remarkable point is that reducing the number of private cars on street contributes to the reduction in air pollution which is having detrimental effects on resident's health. To give evidence, the vast majority of emissions is presently from transportation, compared to that from industries rank the second. It is clear that the environment wouldn't be healed unless the number of vehicles is restricted. Additionally, vehicle-free days can help promote sustainable transportation. While private cars are prohibited, people would turn to the alternative such as walking and cycling which does also benefit their health.

In conclusion, despite there may be discomfort and interruption to certain individuals and businesses, the health and environmental benefits make vehicle-free days a worthwhile initiative in the long run.
