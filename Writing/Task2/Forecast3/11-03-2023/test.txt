The more people opt for English as the language to learn, the fewer people chose other languages. As a consequence, the less popular language will be on the brink of extinction one day, and that is a detrimental impact on the conservation of cultural diversity. Furthermore, the demand of learning English is a tremendous boost to the growth of English teaching centers. It will put a strain unnecessary on the education system as well as expose the students to the threat of being scammed. 

Despite these disadvantages, the growth of English has been contributing to the growth of international collaboration. In the modern flat world, enterprises aim to export their goods to other markets which are out of the country's borders. That objective will be impossible unless the company is in possession of employees who are equipped with English. Additionally, besides the mother tongue, having at least one foreign language is indispensable equipment for everybody to work in the international world. English has been becoming the best choice in this circumstance, it broadens students' minds and exposes them to overseas opportunities.

In conclusion, despite the drawbacks of the conservation of cultural diversity and struggles in education governing affair, the constant spread of English as a worldwide choice of language has been providing strong evidence that its advantages outweighs its disadvantages.
