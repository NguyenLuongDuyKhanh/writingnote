Chating software is now the main choice of people from all walks of life when they need to keep in touch with someone, as a side-effect these applications also affect on how people read and write. Though this might be a debatable topic to somebody, I completely agree that this trend possesses more harm than good.

Good reading habits are being threatened by information which are being provided by computer-based newspapers. Informations on web platform are different to the traditional newspapers or magazines. Those are illustrated in a colorful manner including visual figures which will attract audiences' attention better and result to more people opt those kinds of information instead of the physical one. Frequently digest short information also results to the shortenning of concentrating duration. If a student is used to reading news online, he or she will face the challeges of reading academic materials which demand even tens time as longer as a piece of news online.

Writing skills are declining in the meanwhile. Neither composing a message on a smartphone nor a computer is similar to hand-writing. In the software world, there are abundant of applications which will automatically correct typo and even gramma errors in texts. On one hand, it allows users being careless of these kinds of mistakes to totally focus on the contents what they want to convey in their writing. On the other hand, it causes the reliance on software. Last but not least, using software for chatting facilitates informal tone in writing, it is a detrimental effect for those who want to develop formal writing skills.

In conclusion, besides the undeniable benefits which the advance of the Information Technology sector brings to modern societies, reading and writing skills will decline unless the overuse of these technologies is curbed.
