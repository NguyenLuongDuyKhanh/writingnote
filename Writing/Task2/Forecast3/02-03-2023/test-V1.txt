When it comes to organizing free time activities for children, there are differing opinions. Organizing schedules for children is sometimes a daunting task for parents. While some individuals believe that children should be permitted to choose what to do in a day, I advocate that parents are liable for arranging children's time.

Providing freedom to children is promoted in modern society. If a boy or a girl has control over what to do, they will do it with excitement/enthusiasm, and motivation. For example, every child has a tremendous desire to play, and given the opportunity, children can play sports with enthusiasm and energy for extended periods of time. Additionally, children can develop their self-discipline and organization skills while arranging their own time. Deciding on the order of tasks provides children with a sense of priority, which is important in their academic pursuits in the future.

On the other hand, parental responsibility plays a crucial role in scheduling children's time. By identifying the children's interests and strengths, the parent can make intervene in changing the children's schedule. Eliminating inappropriate activities, and inserting activities that facilitate children's development of skills and talents are some of the actions which parents should take in order to provide their children with comprehensive development. Ultimately, parental restrictions/guidance help prevent children from engaging in immoral and illegal behavior and also ensure their safety from criminal activities. In fact, the vast majority of criminal incidents which involve teenagers are related to parental irresponsibility.

In conclusion, although empowering children to organize their free time brings some benefits, parents are accountable for organizing children's time in order to ensure they are provided with appropriate developments.
