Organizing schedule for children is sometimes a daunting task for parents. While some individuals believe that children should be permitted to opt what to do in a day, I advocate that parents are liable in arranging children time.

Providing freedom to children is promoted in the modern society. If a boy or a girl has control on what to do, they will do it with all excitement and motivation. For example, every child has a tremendous desire to play and they can be energetic all day long on the football field if they have a chance. Additionally, children can cultivate their self-discipline and organization skills while arranging their own time. Deciding the order of tasks provides children the sense of priority, which is important in their academic pursuit in the future.

On the other hand, parent responsibility plays a crucial role in scheduling children time. By identifying the children's interests and strengths, parent can make intervention on changing children schedule. Eliminating inappropriate activities, inserting activities which facilitate children develop skills and talents are some of the actions which parents should take in order to provide the children with comprehensive development. Ultimately, parental restrictions keep children away from immoral and illegal behavior and also keep them secured from criminal activities. In fact, the vast majority of criminal circumstances which involve teenagers are related to parents' irresponsibility.

In conclusion, although empowering children to organize their freetime brings some benefits, parents are accountable in organizing children time in order to ensure they are provided appropriate developments.
